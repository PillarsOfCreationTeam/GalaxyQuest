# Galaxy Quest

Galaxy Quest is an engaging deep space edutainment exploration game. It combines
gamification with the power of citizen science to process large amounts of data
generated by the Hubble telescope.

## Problem

- Hubble currently generates 844 gigabytes of data per month.
- Hubble is only one of the many telescope satellites that will be orbiting the earth.
- James Webb Space Telescope will be launched in March 2021.
- As optical technology evolves, and space technology becomes more affordable,
  our vision is that there will be more imaging sources available generating data.
- Processing and classifying all these data is a hard unsolved problem that
  requires many approaches.

## Solution

Introducing Galaxy Quest, an immersive, space exploration game that leverages
the analysis capabilities of citizen science to:

- Help process and identify elements that require human eye for classification.
- Help train a deep neural network for future automation.
